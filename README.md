### Coding By WEIHA.Thanks.

My personal little App which runs in macos.
A easy statusbar app to monitor your network speed.
You'll see a capsule at the top, and the faster the net speed, the higher the blue stripe! 

### Done and will

- [x] When you click it on statusbar, the system will switch night mode.

- [x] You can set the maximum and minimum values of the record. If this value is exceeded, the capsule will always be full and below the minimum will always be empty. You know that the system may have 1-3k/s normal network interaction even nothing was happened.

- [x] I added an energy-saving button, if you select this button, the StatusBar's view will be refreshed 1.5s, otherwise it will be refreshed once in 1s, which is more expensive.

- [x] You can choose the theme in second page , of Capsule or Circle.  Capsules are simpler, but they look better and cooler.
- [ ] Add a small interface that can watch the detailed network speed, and exhale only when clicking.
- [ ] Can start when the system is login

### Attention!
If the settings are changed, the application must be closed and restarted, I will fix it later.
